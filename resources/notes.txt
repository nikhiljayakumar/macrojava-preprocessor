need to create function that first parses macros into unorderded_map<str a, str b> where a is the input with argument inside, and b is output
use str.find("(") in order to find length of input a. (i.e. foo(arg) = 3, zero(0+1) = 4). This is used to match when the input is checked throughout the code
print out replacement with output b from unorderded_map replacing correct part of code.

copying MacroJavaSpecification in my grammar
creating grammar probably going to be toughest part
problem right now: understand what tokens needed in flex file & understanding how to implement grammar into bison
